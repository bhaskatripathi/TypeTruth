## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the package:

```python
from aitextdetector import AIDetector

# Initialize the detector with the path to your token file
detector = AIDetector("path/to/your/token/file.txt")

# Define some text to analyze
text = """
This is an example text to analyze. It's just a couple of sentences long.
The results of the analysis can tell you whether the text is likely to be generated by an AI.
"""

# Detect the AI content at the sentence level
df = detector.detect(text, split_type='sentence')

# Print the result
print(df)
